# Identifying Customer Segments

I help a German company to target the right audience in its marketing campaign.

### Overview

I work on real-life business datasets and apply unsupervised learning algorithms to identify the customer segments. These are the groups that are especially popular among customers compared to the general population.

### Methods

* Principal component analysis (PCA)
* K-Means algorithm

### Technologies

* Python
* Matplotlib
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Seaborn

## How to use

To take a look at the results, just click on `customer_segments.ipynb` and it should open automatically.

Alternatively you can download the file `customer_segments.html` and open it in your browser to see the results.

## Dataset

Data for this project was provided by the Bertlesmann Arvato Analytics and is not available to the public.

There are two datasets, one concerning the general population and the other one concerning the customers.

#### Size

Both datasets have the same structure and contain information about 85 features. The general one contains 891 211 observations, while the consumer one contains 191 652.
